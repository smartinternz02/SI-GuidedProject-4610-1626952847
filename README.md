An Image classification model is created using CNN and this model is based on the ECG Arrhythmia Classification by Group Dream Team

A model is created by training it over 25k images ( combined both training + testing ) which is then saved as a model.h5 file. 

ECG1.h5 is the model we have created with 95% accuracy which is then integrated into the web page using Flask

All the different web pages have been made using the corresponding HTML files, which is then later called and used accordingly as per the need of the user.

The user can then access the webpage, upload their images and check for the result from there.
