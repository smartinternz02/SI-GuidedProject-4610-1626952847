An Image classification model is created using CNN and this model is based on the ECG Arrhythmia Classification.
A model is created by training it over 25k images ( combined both training + testing ) which is then saved as a model.h5 file. 
ECG.h5 and ECG_1.h5 are the two different models we have created with difference accuracies which is then integrated into the web page using Flask
All the different web pages have been made using the corresponding HTML files, which is then later called and used accordingly as per the need of the user.
